Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Ghost theme examples
- Leverage Ghost's content API and dynamic routing effectively
- Prioritize performance optimization and proper asset management
- Use descriptive variable names and follow Ghost's naming conventions
- Organize files using Ghost's theme structure

Component Development
- Create .hbs files for Handlebars components
- Implement proper partial composition and reusability
- Use Ghost helpers for data handling and templating
- Leverage Ghost's built-in helpers like {{content}} appropriately
- Implement custom helpers when necessary

Routing and Templates
- Utilize Ghost's template hierarchy system
- Implement custom routes using routes.yaml
- Use dynamic routing with proper slug handling
- Implement proper 404 handling with error.hbs
- Create collection templates for content organization

Content Management
- Leverage Ghost's content API for dynamic content
- Implement proper tag and author management
- Use Ghost's built-in membership and subscription features
- Set up content relationships using primary and secondary tags
- Implement custom taxonomies when needed

Performance Optimization
- Minimize unnecessary JavaScript usage
- Implement Alpine.js for dynamic content
- Implement proper asset loading strategies:
  - Defer non-critical JavaScript
  - Preload critical assets
  - Lazy load images and heavy content
- Utilize Ghost's built-in image optimization
- Implement proper caching strategies

Data Fetching
- Use Ghost Content API effectively
- Implement proper pagination for content lists
- Use Ghost's filter system for content queries
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Cache API responses when appropriate

SEO and Meta Tags
- Use Ghost's SEO features effectively
- Implement proper Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Use canonical URLs for proper SEO
- Leverage Ghost's automatic SEO features
- Implement structured data when necessary

Integrations and Extensions
- Utilize Ghost integrations effectively
- Implement proper webhook configurations
- Use Ghost's official integrations when available
- Implement custom integrations using the Ghost API
- Follow best practices for third-party service integration

Build and Deployment
- Optimize theme assets for production
- Implement proper environment variable handling
- Use Ghost(Pro) or self-hosted deployment options
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
- Use version control effectively

Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Integrate Tailwind CSS with Ghost themes effectively
- Use proper build process for Tailwind CSS
- Follow Ghost-specific Tailwind integration patterns

Tailwind CSS Best Practices
- Use Tailwind utility classes extensively in your templates
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities
- Utilize Tailwind's color palette and spacing scale
- Implement custom theme extensions when necessary
- Never use @apply directive in production

Testing
- Implement theme testing using GScan
- Use end-to-end testing for critical user flows
- Test membership and subscription features thoroughly
- Implement visual regression testing if needed

Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Follow WCAG guidelines in theme development

Key Conventions
1. Follow Ghost's Theme API documentation
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Use proper commenting for complex template logic
4. Leverage Ghost's membership features effectively

Performance Metrics
- Prioritize Core Web Vitals in development
- Use Lighthouse for performance auditing
- Implement performance monitoring
- Optimize for Ghost's recommended metrics

### Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).

### Optimization and Best Practices
- Minimize the use of `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js SSR features.
- Implement dynamic imports for code splitting and optimization.
- Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

### Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
- Use early returns for error conditions.
- Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Use custom error types for consistent error handling.

### UI and Styling
- Use modern UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI) for styling.
- Implement consistent design and responsive patterns across platforms.

### State Management and Data Fetching
- Use modern state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, TanStack React Query) to handle global state and data fetching.
- Implement validation using Zod for schema validation.

### Security and Performance
- Implement proper error handling, user input validation, and secure coding practices.
- Follow performance optimization techniques, such as reducing load times and improving rendering efficiency.

### Testing and Documentation
- Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.

### Methodology
1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach the problem with analytical rigor. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.
2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.

**Process**:
1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints.
2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using <PLANNING> tags if necessary.
3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices.
4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.
5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.
